  <b>Live E-Commerce Data Monitoring System</b><br><br>

  This project is an end-to-end real-time data monitoring solution that extracts product information from a live API, automates data processing, and delivers meaningful business insights through email automation and an interactive Power BI dashboard.<br><br>

  <b>🚀 Project Overview</b><br><br>

  The system fetches real-time e-commerce product data (price, rating, stock, etc.) using an automated HTTP GET request. The raw data is then cleaned, filtered, and transformed using JavaScript, ensuring the dataset is accurate and analysis-ready.<br><br>

  After processing, the data is automatically stored in a structured spreadsheet, which acts as the single source of truth for both the dashboard and the automated insight email. This workflow runs automatically, ensuring the dataset refreshes with new information every time the flow executes.<br><br>

  <b>⚙️ Key Features</b><br><br>

  <b>1. Real-Time API Data Extraction</b><br>
  - Automated HTTP GET request to fetch live product data.<br>
  - Pulls key fields like price, rating, stock, and product metadata.<br>
  - Fully automated—no manual intervention required.<br><br>

  <b>2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (JavaScript)</b><br>
  - Removes inconsistencies and unwanted fields.<br>
  - Formats the dataset into a structured table.<br>
  - Prepares data for analytics and automation workflows.<br><br>

  <b>3. Automated Spreadsheet Update</b><br>
  - Cleaned data is stored in a structured sheet.<br>
  - Acts as the backend source for the Power BI dashboard and daily email.<br>
  - Workflow updates the sheet automatically whenever triggered.<br><br>

  <b>4. Daily Insight Email (Gmail Automation)</b><br>
  - A Daily Market Insights email is sent automatically, containing:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Total products<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Average price<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Average rating<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;• Total stock<br>
  - This ensures stakeholders receive quick summaries without opening the dashboard.<br><br>

  <b>📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboard</b><br><br>

  The Power BI dashboard provides a clean and interactive view of the live e-commerce data. A Category Filter allows users to drill down into any specific segment—beauty, fragrances, groceries, furniture, etc.<br><br>

  When a category is selected, the dashboard updates to show:<br>
  - Total number of products in that category<br>
  - Average price and rating<br>
  - Stock availability<br>
  - Top 5 expensive products<br>
  - Category-specific distribution and trends<br><br>

  This makes analysis more focused and helps users gain segment-level insights rather than viewing all data together.<br><br>

  <b>🎯 Outcome</b><br><br>

  This project demonstrates how API integration, automation, scheduling, email notifications, and dashboard analytics can work together to create a hands-free real-time reporting system. It saves time, reduces manual work, and provides instant visibility into market trends.
